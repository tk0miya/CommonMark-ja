"Markdown is a plain text format for writing structured documents, based on "
"conventions for indicating formatting in email and usenet posts.  It was "
"developed by John Gruber (with help from Aaron Swartz) and released in 2004 "
"in the form of a [syntax "
"description](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and a Perl "
"script (`Markdown.pl`) for converting Markdown to HTML.  In the next decade,"
" dozens of implementations were developed in many languages.  Some extended "
"the original Markdown syntax with conventions for footnotes, tables, and "
"other document elements.  Some allowed Markdown documents to be rendered in "
"formats other than HTML.  Websites like Reddit, StackOverflow, and GitHub "
"had millions of people using Markdown. And Markdown started to be used "
"beyond the web, to author books, articles, slide shows, letters, and lecture"
" notes."

"What distinguishes Markdown from many other lightweight markup syntaxes, "
"which are often easier to write, is its readability. As Gruber writes:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../spec.txt:32
msgid ""
"The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to make it as"
" readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should"
" be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked "
"up with tags or formatting instructions. "

"The point can be illustrated by comparing a sample of "

"The AsciiDoc version is, arguably, easier to write. You don't need to worry "

"How much indentation is needed for a sublist?  The spec says that "
"continuation paragraphs need to be indented four spaces, but is not fully "

"indented four spaces, but `Markdown.pl` does not require that.  This is "
"hardly a \"corner case,\" and divergences between implementations on this "
"issue often lead to surprises for users in real documents. (See [this "

"Is a blank line needed before a block quote or heading? Most implementations"
" do not require the blank line.  However, this can lead to unexpected "
"results in hard-wrapped text, and also to ambiguities in parsing (note that "
"some implementations put the heading inside the blockquote, while others do "
"not). (John Gruber has also spoken [in favor of requiring the blank "

"In the first phase, lines of input are consumed and the block structure of "

"Link reference definitions are parsed and a map of links is constructed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../spec.txt:9389
msgid ""
"In the second phase, the raw text contents of paragraphs and headings are "

" phase 1."

"turn, have other blocks as children.  The last child of a block is normally "
"considered **open**, meaning that subsequent lines of input can alter its "
"contents.  (Blocks that are not open are **closed**.) Here, for example, is "
"a possible document tree, with the open blocks marked by arrows:"

#: ../../spec.txt:9417
msgid "Phase 1: block structure"

#: ../../spec.txt:9419
msgid ""
"Each line that is processed has an effect on this tree.  The line is "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First we iterate through the open blocks, starting with the root document, "
"and descending through last children down to the last open block.  Each "
"block imposes a condition that the line must satisfy if the block is to "
"remain open.  For example, a block quote requires a `>` character.  A "
"paragraph requires a non-blank line. In this phase we may match all or just "
"some of the open blocks.  But we cannot close unmatched blocks yet, because "
"we may have a [lazy continuation line]."

"Finally, we look at the remainder of the line (after block markers like `>`,"
